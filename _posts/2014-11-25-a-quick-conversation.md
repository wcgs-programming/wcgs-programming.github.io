> A python program that lets you talk to the computer. The computer doesn't seem very interested though...

> The code behind the scenes:

    c = str(raw_input("Do you like me?: "))
    
    if c == "No" or c == "no":
        print("Go away. Never speak to me again.")
    if c == "Yes" or c == "yes":
        print("I like me too.")
    else:
        print("Plz enter something legit.")
