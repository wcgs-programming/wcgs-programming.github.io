> Another short Python program by Bertie, to find the factorial of a certain number.
> You can download it [here](/files/showcase/Bertie/factorial-calculator.py).
> Take a look at the code:

    while 1 == 1:
    num = int(raw_input("What number do you want the factorial of?"))
    num2 = 1
    while num>1:
        num2 = num2 * num
        num = num -1
    print(num2)
