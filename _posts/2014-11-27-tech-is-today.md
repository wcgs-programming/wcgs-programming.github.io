	<p> <u>Blackberry's Situation</u> </p>

	<p> Blackberry Z10 is their first flagship smartphone from RIM (Resaerch in Motion) of featuring the brand new Blackberry 10 OS.There are other blackberry phones that support the brand new OS to like the Q5, Q10 and the latest flagship which is the Z30, the new phablet featuring natural sound technology and the SuperAmol 5" display.Blackberry have update onto Blackberry OS 10.2 which they say the battery lif had been improved. It hasn't yet released onto Blackberry Z10 but it has for the Z10. As you know, recently, RIM have been having trouble and the phones haven't attracted anybody much. It is mainly because of there apps. The latest smartphones, Iphone 5s,5c, Samsung galaxy Note 3,S4 are the top selling smartphones now. Htc joins the competition too. Blackberry is a Canadian phone company who makes smartphones and tablets. They have so far stopped the tablets as they lost the battle between the Samusng Galaxy Tabs and the Nexus's and also the Ipads. There smarphone fans have moved from to android and Apple. They have lost it. Blackberry fans were the most famous before because of BBM and the best quert keypad, but now as they let out BBM to other platforms, it's a disadvantage. They still have the best keyboards in the wolrd but iimprovement haven't change the fans. If you see a person with a Blackberry, you won't go WOW! like you would to an Iphone 5s.Blackberry was made for business. If you are looking to buy a Blackberry however for any reason, the Z10 is reccommened. It is becuase its a 4.2" smartphone so the right size. It has 1.5GH dual core processor backed up by 800mzh snapdragon. The Z10 features video calling now on BBM. The Blackberry 10OS is a gesture type phone. Unlike scrolling from the top to view your notification like on IOS and Android, you now swipe up and then to the left. Blackberry is in a tough situation right now. They have to sell their company to Microsoft who offered them the most money. Its not that it will happen. When their other new smartphones come out and if they get a big hit, the company would use the money to pay back their problem and stay. </p>
