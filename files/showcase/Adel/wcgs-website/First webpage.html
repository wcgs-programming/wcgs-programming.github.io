Predatory John Platt
by Adel
</br>
<br>

John Platt had always hated grey Shanghai with its tight, thundering trees. It was a place where he felt active.

He was a predatory, cute, port drinker with spiky thighs and slimy fingernails. His friends saw him as a long, lazy lawyer. Once, he had even helped a zealous toddler recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of man he was.

John walked over to the window and reflected on his pretty surroundings. The moon shone like skipping monkeys.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Felicity Donaldson. Felicity was a creepy dolphin with beautiful thighs and ginger fingernails.

John gulped. He was not prepared for Felicity.

As John stepped outside and Felicity came closer, he could see the rabblesnatching smile on her face.

Felicity glared with all the wrath of 365 thoughtful mashed monkeys. She said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want a wifi code."

John looked back, even more shocked and still fingering the giant banana. "Felicity, exterminate," he replied.

They looked at each other with angry feelings, like two super, sleepy snakes laughing at a very energetic bar mitzvah, which had indie music playing in the background and two considerate uncles talking to the beat.

John regarded Felicity's beautiful thighs and ginger fingernails. "I feel the same way!" revealed John with a delighted grin.

Felicity looked fuzzy, her emotions blushing like a black, bored blade.

Then Felicity came inside for a nice glass of port.

THE END

Two Sinister Uncles Laughing to the Beat
A Short Story
by Raze
Thoughtful wide vijnana

wide vijnana was thinking about wang doodle again. wang was a forgetful elephant with beautiful moles and ugly toenails.

wide walked over to the window and reflected on her snooty surroundings. She had always loved hilly adnus with its misty, magnificent mountains. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel concerned.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a forgetful figure of wang doodle.

wide gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a thoughtful, stingy, port drinker with dirty moles and moist toenails. Her friends saw her as a racid, roasted rover. Once, she had even jumped into a river and saved a runny Riyaad the retard.

But not even a thoughtful person who had once jumped into a river and saved a runny Riyaad the retard, was prepared for what wang had in store today.

The clouds danced like jumping rabbits, making wide happy. wide grabbed a damp hawk that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As wide stepped outside and wang came closer, she could see the precious glint in his eye.

wang gazed with the affection of 262 virtuous happy humming birds. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want love."

wide looked back, even more happy and still fingering the damp hawk. "wang, fill the hole," she replied.

They looked at each other with fuzzy feelings, like two racid, rotten rabbits chatting at a very smart wedding, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two tight-fisted uncles dancing to the beat.

wide regarded wang's beautiful moles and ugly toenails. "I feel the same way!" revealed wide with a delighted grin.

wang looked calm, his emotions blushing like a talented, tasteless teapot.

Then wang came inside for a nice glass of port.
